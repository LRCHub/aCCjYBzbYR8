(I dunno)

Brown baby
Brown baby
As you grow up
I want you to drink from the plenty cup
I want you to stand up tall and proud
And I want you to speak up clear and loud
Brown baby
Brown baby
Brown baby

As years go by I want you to go with your head up high
I want you to live by the justice code
And I want you to walk down freedom's road
You little brown baby

So lie away, lie away sleeping, lie away singing
Lie away sleeping, lie away safe in my arms
'Til your daddy and your momma protect you
And keep you safe from harm
Brown baby

It makes me glad
You're gonna have things that I never had
Oh, in other man's heart all the hate is heard
Sweety, you're gonna live in a better world
Brown baby
Brown baby
Brown baby
