It's a beautiful day today
Everything is going my way
Even the words do what I say
Oh, babe, got to get away

To be impossible
Isn't that difficult?
In the city you're invisible
When you come from a small town

Everything is all right
Everything is all right
I'm not your baby
Please

A tourist in a traffic jam
Baby sham and handy cam
I'm not your mother, you're not my man
I'm not your baby

Don't treat like I'm a trick
I won't treat you like you're a prick
Don't need no doctor I'm not ill
I'm not your baby

Everything is all right
Everything is all right
I'm not your baby
Please

Cut out the poetry
Let's hit the main artery
No time for a tourniquet
The colors all run out on me
You brought me all kinds of goods
Now my heart is so full up it hurts
Is heavy as a shopping bag
Is full of things I should give back

Everything is all right (Everything)
Everything is all right (Everything is all right)
I'm not your baby (Oh, I'm not your baby)
Please (Please)

I'm not your baby
I'm not your baby

Don't want you to cover me
Smother me or mother me
I like to feel this incomplete
I'm not your baby

Everything is all right
Everything is all right
I'm not your baby
Please

Thell 'em busy, just busy
Didn't drink nothing fizzy
No pills to feel easy
Don't know what got into me

Daylight is a kind of robbery
The night is your geography
So you're not white you're pink and rosy
You could be right but you're way above me

Me, I'm in recovery
A star of pornography
I'm a tourist there's a lot to see
You don't like the photographs of me

So you've got a lot to say
You don't sleep around but sometimes you stray
You don't believe but often times you pray
For something, what is it babe?

Don't treat me like I'm a trick
I won't treat you like you're a prick
Don't need no doctor I'm not sick
I'm not your baby

Everything is all right
Everything is all right
I'm not your baby
Please

I'm not your baby
I'm not your baby
I'm not your baby
I'm not your baby
I'm not your baby
I'm not your baby
I'm not your baby
